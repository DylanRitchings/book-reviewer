## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) web app. I have created a  website where users can upload, edit and delete reviews about books.


## Technologies
Project created using:
* Scrum Board: Jira
* Database: GCP Managed SQL Server, H2 Client Side for testing
* Programming language: Java with Spring Boot
* Front-end: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* API Development Testing: Postman and Swagger
* Testing: JUnit, Mockito and Spring Test
* Version Control: Git

## Risk Management
A risk is an event that is uncertain that will cause an effect on an objective.
* Qualitative risk assessment where risks are split into impact and likelyhood.
* **Risk Category:** What the risk impacts. For this current project completion rate is the most important category due to to the limited time for completion.
* **Likelyhood:** How likely the event is to occure.
* **Impact:** How much the category is impacted if the event occurs.
* **Matrix:** A matrix is used to assess the priority of each risk.
A response to the risk is then formulated. The response will either remove the risk completely, reduce its serverity or explain what was done to attempt to reduce the serverity.

## Project Tracking
In Jira MOSCOW prioritization was used. Only the must have stories were implemented.

## Frontend Design
A [low level design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xLXwMK-aSNpBKKriDs_NNFMP2Qqk-3go/view?usp=sharing) was drawn on paper. The final design was created using HTML and CSS. This is the final frontend webpage:

## Javascript Function Diagram
This diagrams shows the different types of functions and how they call eachother in the JS frontend.

## Frontend to Backend Data Flow Diagram
This diagram shows how data and requests are sent from the front-end to the backend:

## Proposed ERD
This is a planned SQL structure.

## Testing
Two types of tests were used for this project. Junit and Mockito were used for unit tests which test each individual function on its own to assert it produces the correct output. Mockito allows the parts of the application that are not being tested to be mocked. Junit handles the assertions which check whether the correct output has been output in relation to the inputs and outputs of the mock classes. Both the services and controllers were unit tested.

Integration testing is used to test parts of the application together. Spring Mock MVC was used to mock JSON calls to application. H2 database was used to mock the database so that testing data was not saved to the production database. The controller was used as the test input. The other parts of the application were tested through the controller.
This is the coverage report for all the tests:

## Future Improvements
* Split the single database into multiple so that it is normalized and further features can be added with greater ease
* Include Java repository testing to make sure application is fully tested
* Create a way for users to search for reviews about specific books or authors
* Create book profile page so that users can see reviews for different books
* Integrate user accounts so that users can edit and delete their own reviews
