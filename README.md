## Risk Management
A risk is an event that is uncertain that will cause an effect on an objective.
* Qualitative risk assessment where risks are split into impact and likelyhood.
* **Risk Category:** What the risk impacts. For this current project completion rate is the most important category due to to the limited time for completion.
* **Likelyhood:** How likely the event is to occure.
* **Impact:** How much the category is impacted if the event occurs.
A response to the risk is then formulated. The response will either remove the risk completely, reduce its serverity or explain what was done to attempt to reduce the serverity.
