## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) web app. I have created a  website where users can upload, edit and delete reviews about books.


## Technologies
Project created using:
* Scrum Board: Jira
* Database: GCP Managed SQL Server
* Programming language: Java
* Front-end: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Unit Tests: JUnit and Mockito
* Version Control: Git

## Risk Management
TODO RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX
A risk is an event that is uncertain that will cause an effect on an objective.
* Qualitative risk assessment where risks are split into impact and likelyhood.
* **Risk Category:** What the risk impacts. For this current project completion rate is the most important category due to to the limited time for completion.
* **Likelyhood:** How likely the event is to occure.
* **Impact:** How much the category is impacted if the event occurs.
A response to the risk is then formulated. The response will either remove the risk completely, reduce its serverity or explain what was done to attempt to reduce the serverity.
